# mono-game-lib
My attempt to create custom engine (result is more like lib)

As a part of creating game of my dreams, I starts with lib, which helps me create it

Result is optimized (for my game) standard MonoGame script for rendering 2D items

Also rendering text is really terrible strange, but it works properly

This lib is archive, do whatever you want with it
